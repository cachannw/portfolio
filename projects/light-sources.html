        Designing an Emotion Tracking App for Improved Mood Management
      </p>
      <p class="project-brief p">
        Light Source Limited is a personal development training organization
        that helps children and adults better manage their emotions and
        behavior. However, even with abundant assistance, understanding one's
        challenges is the first step toward improvement. This app achieves
        exactly that—helping people recognize their emotional patterns while
        recording daily events.

          <h4>Challenge</h4>
          <p class="p">
            The app is aim to track people's emotions, allowing them to record
            their thoughts and play music to comfort them. Additionally, there
            should be a section for sharing resources from the education center.

        <div>
          <h4>Opportunity</h4>
          <p class="p">
            It is a great opportunity to enhance the overall learning experience
            for current members of the center, as well as an excellent way to
            attract new learners. I take a step back to understand how emotion
            management works and approach it in a holistic manner.

          <h4>My Impact</h4>
          <p class="p">
            I worked on this project as a solo designer alongside an engineer. I
            was responsible for the creation of all discovery and design
            deliverables, utilizing various online assets, such as
            illustrations, to enhance the design.

      <!-- Design Process -->

      <h4 class="section-title">Design Process</h4>
      <h4>Getting Started</h4>
      <p class="p">
        There are many potential features for the app, taking into account both
        the requests from the education center and the possible needs of the
        users.
      </p>
      <div class="project-images grid-2-col">
        <div class="spread-2-col">
          <img
            src="../images/emotion-tracking-app/mind map.png"
            alt="An image showing the mind mapping."
          />
        </div>
      </div>

      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

      <h4>Wireframing</h4>
      <p class="p">
        After filtering the features, I began creating a wireframe and
        communicating with the education center. The features and wireframe met
        their expectations, so I started to create a high-fidelity design.

          <h4>Style Guide</h4>
          <p class="p">
            The education center requested a yellow theme to indicate happiness.
            Therefore, I chose to use a bright yellow alongside some grey brown.
            Initially, black was considered as the button color; however, since
            black is traditionally viewed as "unlucky" in the Chinese community,
            we decided against using it.

      <!-- User Journey -->

      <hr />
      <h4 class="section-title">User Journey</h4>

      <p class="p">
        While designing the app, I gained knowledge on emotion management
        through online lessons taught by professional counselors. There are four
        steps in managing emotions:
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        1. Identify the emotion — recognize its existence and name it <br />
        2. Understand emotion — uncover the "why" behind it <br />
        3. Adjust emotion — maintain control <br />
        4. Express emotion — communicate effectively with words
      </p>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      <div class="grid-2-col">
        <div>
          <h4>Recognize its existence and Name it</h4>
          <p class="p">
            We encounter a wide range of emotions, including joy, sadness,
            anger, anxiety, shame, and many others. Simply labeling a feeling as
            "bad" doesn't provide clarity. That's why identifying the specific
            emotion is one of the first steps in recording it. The learning
            centre has selected some of the most common emotions for users to
            choose from, and users can also add their own.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
          <img
            src="../images/emotion-tracking-app/screenshot 1 .png"
            alt="A screenshot from the app where users can choose a specific emotion to record."
          />
        </div>
      </div>
      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      <h4>Uncover the “why” behind it</h4>
      <p class="p">
        Now we need to understand why emotions appear, as sometimes their roots
        lie deeper than we might imagine. For example, anger toward someone
        could stem from an underlying fear. This app offers two ways to help.
      </p>

      <p class="p">
        1. <strong>Users can select what causes the emotion</strong>: When
        recording an emotion, users is recommended to select the category that
        triggered it. This helps them identify the initial cause of their
        reaction.
      </p>
      <p class="p">
        2. <strong>Emotion analysis</strong>: Another major feature of the app
        is the analysis report generated from users' emotion records. It shows
        the fluctuation of their moods, the percentage breakdown of how they
        feel, and what factors are most associated with those feelings.

      <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
      <h4>Maintain control</h4>
      <p class="p">
        If users want to express more, they can write a diary entry about their
        emotions. Putting thoughts into words helps clear their minds and
        creates space for clearer thinking. After recording their emotions and
        events, users can listen to soothing music and sound effects we've
        prepared, offering a brief escape from reality.

        <div>
          <h4>How to record the intensity of emotion?</h4>
          <p class="p">
            When users log their emotions, they start by selecting the
            intensity. We initially considered a scale ranging from -5 to 5, but
            we found that ten options were excessive. As a result, we decided to
            simplify the process by offering five distinct intensity levels
            instead.

        </div>
        <div>
          <h4>How to show mood fluctuation?</h4>
          <p class="p">
            In the generated report, we display mood fluctuation. Initially, we
            considered using bar charts to classify emotions into positive and
            negative groups. However, after consulting potential users, we
            decided not to emphasize "positive" or "negative" emotions. Instead,
            we switched to line charts to show the fluctuation, providing a more
            neutral representation of emotional changes over time.
          </p>

      <!-- Summary -->

      <hr />
      <h4 class="section-title">Summary</h4>
      <p class="p">
        This is a meaningful project aimed at helping people manage their
        emotions while also supporting the growth of the learning center.
        Throughout this process, I have learned a great deal about design and
        emotion management from professionals. In terms of design, it has been
        challenging to incorporate all features in a meaningful and
        user-friendly manner. After considerable effort in compositing and
        analyzing how other apps approach this, we have finally completed the
        app, and the education center is pleased with the design!
