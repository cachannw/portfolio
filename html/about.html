          Hello, my name is Rebecca Chan. I am a budding UX/UI designer with a
          passion for creating intuitive and engaging user experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was gruduated from HKUST. After graducation, I started working at
          BOCHK in the HR department for 4.5 years, where I accumulated
          experience working with several parties. In the mean time, I began to
          realize my passion for art and design. I worked with 2D and 3D art in
          free time and soon discovered my aspiration to work as a professional
          UX/UI designer.
        </p>

        <p>
          In June 2023, I decided to take a break from work to reassess my
          career path. However, I didn't stop being productive. I participated
          in a volunteer trip as one of the organizers, leading secondary school
          students to Thailand. I am also responsible for several material
          design.
        </p>
        <p>
          During this period, I also enrolled in an app and website design
          course to enhance my skills. I designed a real-world application
          (currently under development) for an educational organization.
          Additionally, I learned to code, and I am proud to say that I built
          this website myself!
        </p>

        <p>
          In my free time, watercolor painting is my favorite hobby. I enjoy the
          process of painting and the joy of sharing my work with friends and
          fellow students! It has been a wonderful journey!
        </p>
