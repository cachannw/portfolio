        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          I designed an emotion tracking app for Light Sources Limited, a
          self-development education center that helps children and adults
          better manage their emotions and behavior. As the sole designer, I
          handled all aspects of the project—from research and asset selection
          to copywriting—creating a development-ready application. The app is
          currently in development.

        <h2>Problem</h2>
        <p>
          In Hong Kong, more and more people are facing emotional challenges.
          While experts can assist those in need, it's crucial for individuals
          to recognize their own emotions and understand the underlying causes.
          This self-awareness isn't easy to achieve! Could an app help people
          become more conscious of their emotional fluctuations?

          <p>Starting from basic, what is emotion management?</p>

          To understand the subject better, I attended an online course taught
          by a professional counsellor. Through the course, I learned that
          emotion management consists of <strong>four main steps</strong>.

          Based on the research results, I aim to design an app that addresses
          each identified difficulty. Additionally, we hope this app will expand
          the learning center's business by increasing the reach of their
          educational resources.

          According to the Learning Center, this app should be accessible to

          Claire is frustrated with her anger issues and her relationship with

            In what ways can the app support Claire in developing healthier

          Based on the research and analysis of Claire’s user journey, I believe
          that our app should provide the following value to help her better
          manage her emotions. The app should:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Assist her in understanding her triggers and emotional patterns,
            such as identifying topics she is sensitive to or times of the month
            when she tends to be in a bad mood.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide effective coping strategies that Claire can use whenever she
            is feeling down.
          </li>
          <li>
            Include clear progress monitoring, allowing Claire to track her
            emotional growth over time.
          </li>
          <li>
            Offer reliable educational resources related to emotional
            well-being.
          </li>
          <li>
            Incorporate reminders or encouragement mechanisms to promote regular
            use of the app.
          </li>
          <li>
            Foster community support by connecting her with other users who
            share similar experiences.
